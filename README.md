# Plant-Tycoon-Calculator
A simple tool for calculating and searching for plant pollination results for the game Plant Tycoon.


## How to use:
The first calculator solves for what the result of cross-pollinating two plants would be. Selecting a foliage/flower option should automatically show the result; otherwise use the Manual Pollinate button.

The second calculator shows possible crosses that would result in the plant of your choice.
